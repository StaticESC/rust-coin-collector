# rust-coin-collector

## A Work-In-Progress 'game' made using the bevy game engine along with the rapier physics engine on Rust!

The main idea behing this is for me to learn 1) Rust, 2) Bevy, 3) Machine Learning
There will be a bot placed in the game environment such that it collects coins in an efficient manner using machine learning
